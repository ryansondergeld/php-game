## Formation
Each team has a group of 5 characters.  Each character can be in the front row or the back row. 
Characters in the front row gain an extra attack bonus.
Characters in the back row gain an extra defense bonus.  

## Turn order
A turn order will be determined based on the character's speed statistic.  The highest speed gets to go first followed by the next highest speed, etc.  
In an event where two characters have the same speed stat, luck will be looked at to determine which goes first.  
In the event that the luck stat is the same, a random number will determine which character goes first (coin flip = 50/50)  

## Sequence of Events  
The characters will go in the order determined above.  
If the unit's stamina is 0 or less, its turn will be skipped.  
Each character will pick a target based on their attack and deal damage to an enemy unit.  
- Some classes will target the weakest, some the strongest, and some classes will target the entire front row, entire back row, or all units.
The unit will deal damage to the other unit.
If an entire side's units all have a stamina of 0 or less, the other side instanly wins and no more turns are executed.
If both sides have units with stamina at the end of the round, the team that dealt the most damage will be the winner.  This damage includes anything above and beyond the other unit's stamina points.  For example, if a unit did 15 damage against another unit with a stamina of 7, the value used to determine the winner wil be the 15 and not the 7.
