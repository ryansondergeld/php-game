## Strengths and Weaknesses
Each class may have strengths and weaknesses.  
If the attack is against a class with a strenth in that attack, damage will use the weak multiplier (0.5)  
If the attack is against a class with a weakness in that attack, damage will use the strength multiplier (1.5)  
Otherwise, the multiplier will be 1.0.  

For example, a class can be strong against Dark, Fire, Ice, and Lightning but weak against Sword, Polearm, and Staff.  

Some units may have abilities that grant additional strenths or weaknesses.
